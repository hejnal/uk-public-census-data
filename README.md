# uk-public-census-data
This repo contains a publicly available UK Census 2011 data ready to be used in custom data driven use cases.

100% of the data is referenced in the public sources. In some cases, there was some manual operations (like removing the headers, or exporting data from excel file), so the output is ready to be loaded to Big Query. There's a manual list of main UK cities (from Wikipedia) with the UK Census 2011 stats as this information was hard to find in the official census registry.
