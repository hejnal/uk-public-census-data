## How to download census data?
Visit [Census page](https://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/ods-web/data-warehouse.html#standarddatatab)
and download Local Characteristic Postcode Sector zip file, and then choose the KS101SC.csv file. For cities choose Settlement 2010 file and then choose KS101SC.csv. You'll need to postprocess them (removing some headers) before loading this file into BQ.
