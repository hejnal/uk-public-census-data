## How to download census data?
Visit [Census page](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160512120605/http://www.nisra.gov.uk/census/2011/results/postcode.html)
and download the Headcount and Household Estimates (Excel 2 MB) file. 

For the Settlement statistcis (city_level), the link on the webarchive does not work, please use this [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/census-2011-headcount-and-household-estimates-for-settlements-northern-ireland) instead.
